## This is a framework to help you create DDL based oracle views that transforms JSON objects called over Oracle Rest Data Services to relational Oracle views.

This framework was created to prove that you can use Oracle Rest Data Services (ORDS) isntead of traditional database links to enable to not only communicate between databases but also since data is fetched as a REST based service not depend on database links that are closed inside the Oracle database.
